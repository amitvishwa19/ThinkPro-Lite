If someone asks for your password, ask him/her to see this document. If you suspect that your passwords have been compromised, report the incident to the Global Helpdesk and change all passwords. We may conduct password-cracking exercises (on a periodic or random basis). If your password is cracked during one of these scans, you will be required to change it. Change your password at least once every 30 days.
